ReDI Projects
=============

This application can be used during ReDI school classes as an endpoint
the students can program against.

This application is provides a portal listing a set of projects.
Individual projects can be created, managed and voted upon by authenticated
users.

The idea is that each student creates their own web application where they
can:

1. Manage their own project submissions
2. Vote on all the available projects

The main redi-projects app is hosted on heroku at: [https://redi-projects.herokuapp.com](https://redi-projects.herokuapp.com).

A `redi` [gem](https://github.com/RefugeesOnRails/redi-gem) exists to make it easier
to interact with the API of the redi-projects site.
